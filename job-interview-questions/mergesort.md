Interview Questions: Mergesort
==============================

Question 1
----------

**Merging with smaller auxiliary array.** Suppose that the subarray a[0] to a[N-1] is sorted and the subarray a[N] to a[2*N-1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that a[0] to a[2*N-1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of size N (instead of 2N)?

Answer 1
--------



Question 2
----------

**Counting inversions.** An inversion in an array a[] is a pair of entries a[i] and a[j] such that i<j but a[i]>a[j]. Given an array, design a linearithmic algorithm to count the number of inversions.

Answer 1
--------



Question 3
----------

**Shuffling a linked list.** Given a singly-linked list containing N items, rearrange the items uniformly at random. Your algorithm should consume a logarithmic (or constant) amount of extra memory and run in time proportional to NlogN in the worst case.
